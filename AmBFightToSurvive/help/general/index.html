		<h1>Fight to Survive Help</h1>
		<p>Well, hello there. It seems that you have stumbled upon the help menu, whose
		main job is to teach you how to play fight to survive as impemented on this server. First
		off, the help menu can be opened and closed at any time with F1, but if you are a first time
		player, it is very bad idea to press that button right now. This gamemode is a unique combination
		of fighting, strategy and building that you would probably not see elsewhere.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>So, you're probably going all <i>"wtf, i wanna play this game now, lol"</i>. Well, if you can just make it
		through this next paragraph, you should know enough to start playing. Just hold in there for a bit.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>The object of this game is to get rich. The amount of money you have is measured in ResPs(Resource Points). ResPs
		allow you to buy all sorts of things from the games store(F4). You can see your ResPs along with other team's ResPs
		by pressing TAB. Now this is good and all, but you need to start making some ResPs before anything else. Press F2 to make or join
		a team. Once you're in a team, you can see an overview of the game with the map(F3). The large filled square is you. As you
		can see, this square is the same color as your team. You might also be able to see smaller squares with the same color. These
		guys are your teammates, try your best to avoid killing them. The large unfilled squares are refineries, the centers and backbones
		of bases. Refineries are needed to convert raw resources into usable ResPs. Refineries show up on the map with their owning teams
		color, and will emit a beam of that color in the game. You can capture these for your own team by clearing out all enemy players
		around it and staying close by for a period of time. Once your team has captured a refinery, its time to build up a base. The goal
		of the base is to protect your refinery from capture and provide a safezone for your team. When you spawn props, they will first
		appear wireframe. This is the only time you may move them with the physics gun and use tools on them. The wireframe props are
		easily destroyed and can be walked through. Once you have placed all the wireframe props for your base, its time to construct
		it. When you are spawned, you are supplied with the constructer tool. Use this tool to convert wireframe props in to stronger solid
		props at the cost of ResPs. You may later deconstructed them back to wireframe props by using the secondary on the constructer
		tool. Now that you have a base that you are reasonably satisfied with, you can start collecting raw resources. These will periodically
		drop from the sky in crates(appearing as a cross on the map). You must go to the crates and try to capture the resources before
		any other team. The resources will appear as a weapon and you may only hold onto one at a time. Once you grabbed the resources, you
		must dash to your refinery and avoid any other teams trying to steal it. Once you are close to the refinery, you may drop the resources
		with primary fire. The refinery will begin absorbing the resources, converting them into ResPs, which you can reedem at the store(F4) for
		better weapons, improvements and tools... </p>
		<br/>
		<p>Now, you are ready to play. Hit F4 and give it a go.</p>
